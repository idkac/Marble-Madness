This is how to build MarbleMadness in a macOS Terminal window, assuming
you've already installed XQuartz.

1. Download the Mac command line skeleton for MarbleMadness and unzip it.
2. To build the program, change into the MarbleMadness directory and type
		make
3. To run the program, type
		./MarbleMadness

GAME CONTROLS:
To move in the game: use WASD
Press SPACE to shoot

If you wish to create your own custom levels, go into the Assets folder and edit the existing .txt files to make your own changes. It is also possible for you to make a new level as long as you keep the naming consistent.

The game is overall fairly simple so I will leave it up to you to figure it out.
